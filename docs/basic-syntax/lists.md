Add ordered (numbered) and unordered lists to slides to present information as bullet points.

To create an unordered list, start the line with `*`

or `-`

.
Alternatively, you can also use `+`

to create a [Unordered Fragmented List](/obsidian-advanced-slides/extend-syntax/fragmentedlists/)

To create an ordered list, start the line with any number, followed by a dot and a space. The slide will show the correct numbers in the list.
