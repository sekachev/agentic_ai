You can insert Emoji shortcodes in your slide.

```


Any shortcode you write in your markdown notes will be automatically shown as an emoji in the slide preview.

If you want to have full support for shortcode’s autocompletion or viewing them in reading mode, this plugin is the perfect companion: [Obsidian Emoji Shortcodes](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-emoji-shortcodes)
